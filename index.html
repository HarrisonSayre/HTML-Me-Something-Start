            <h1>What is Brimstone Adventures?</h1>
               <p1>Founded in 2021, Brimstone Adventures is a Discord-based role-playing server for the current edition of the Deadlands&reg; tabletop role-playing game, centered around the titular boomtown, where I act as a senior gamemaster and server moderator.
                  Brimstone has hosted over three hundred game sessions, and at one point boasted over sixty active players.

            <h2>What is Deadlands: The Weird West?</h2>
               <embed type="video/webm" src=".\images\WWVid.mp4" width="900" height="300">
               <p1><br>Deadlands&reg; is a tabletop role-playing game created by Shane Lacey Hensley in the year 1996. 
                  The game is a genre mashup of westerns, supernatural horror, and steampunk science fiction, focusing on an alternate history where magic secretly returned to the world in the early 1860s, shortly followed by a miracle mineral that could seemingly break the laws of physics. 
                  The end result is an extended American Civil War and a divided country featuring feuding nations and rail barons where cowpokes, settlers, indigenous peoples, and mad scientists try to fend off what goes bump in the night. 
                  The most recent edition of the game came out in 2021, which, not coincidentally, is when the Brimstone Adventures game server started. The above video is actually a promotion from its then upcoming kickstartrer.

            <h2>What is a West Marshes Server?</h2>
               <p1>A West Marshes server is a Discord server where a West Marshes-style campaign is ran, but that begs the obvious question. 
                  In its most simple form, a West Marshes campaign is a role-playing campaign where, instead of the traditional setup of a single gamemaster and a single, consistent group, there are instead multiple gamemasters and a much larger player pool adventuring in a shared continuity. 
                  A town serves as the central, in-universe hub, Brimstone in this case, and each gamemaster runs games set in the same world when they feel like doing so, and/or when enough players express interest in a certain plot hook. 
                  The exact composition of a given group can thus vary wildly, as can style of game being ran, but it's all at least loosely connected. 
                  A West Marshes game is thus more than the sum of its parts.</p1>

               <a name = "joining"></a>
               <h2>Joining</h2>
                  <p1>I came to Brimstone near the very beginning. Having gamemastered a two year long Deadlands campaign back in school, I had been keenly following the Kickstarter for the then new latest edition, and that in turn meant I'd been monitoring social media. 
                     I saw a post advertising a West Marshes-style Deadlands game using the just released new edition, and, having never played Deadlands as a player, jumped at the change to join. Sadly, I didn't play in the very first game ever ran in the server, but Elijah Murray, the elderly gunslinger, and I did make our debut in the second one.
                     I loved every game I played in and my interactions with the other player and their characters. While I love running games, playing in them is a different, equally fun experience and one I very rarely got to enjoy. I was content to just be a player, but fate had other things in store </p1>
            <a name = "gamemastering"></a>
            <h2>Gamemastering</h2>
                     <p1>Sometimes, when you're a gamemaster, you come up with adventure ideas. 
                        That was the case one day, and I asked one of the moderators of Brimstone if I could run a oneshot adventure involving a boxer, his crooked, spellcasting promoter, and a band of vengeful outlaw women after the latter. 
                        Fight Night proved to be a big success, but a dangling plot hook from it caused a sequel to be requested. From there came another. 
                        And soon enough, despite my promise to myself that this was going to be a one-time thing, soon enough I was both playing and running.</p1>
            <a name = "moderator"></a>
            <h2>Moderator</h2>
                     <p1>Gamemastering is hard, time consuming work. So is moderating a community. Doing both at the same time? Exponentially harder than the already challenging separate tasks. 
                        So it's no shame or surprise when the original admins and GMs of the Brimstone server began to ride off into the sunset one by one. When nobody else was GMing I just kept on putting up games and helped support the text-based in-character chat as well. 
                        Other GMs gradually came in, but for while I was the only one keeping the lights on, and for my actions I was asked if I wanted to become a server moderator. 
                        I accepted this honor, and still am to this day, helping Brimstone and the community of people that has built up around our games grow and prosper.</p1>

                  <p1><br>Elijah Murray was my first character in the server, designed when I originally intended to just be a player. 
                     His primary inspiration was Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer from Sergio Leone's A Few Dollars More. 
                     An elderly gunslinger who lost his family to an unexplained massacre, Elijah has a death wish, but, unfortunately for him, mechanically he was built to be extremely hard to kill. 
                     Gruff, laconic, and quick to heroics, but plagued by guilt over the people he's killed, he also takes come cues from the protagonist of Unforgiven. 
                     Much to his annoyance he's become the subject of several inaccurate dime novels, much to the amusement of his friends and new found family. 
                     Semi-retired as an active character now, Elijah also holds the distinction of being the best horseman among the player characters.</p1>

                  </figure>
                  <p1><br>Lillie Hutchins was my second character, and much less of a "classic" western character than Elijah. 
                     While seemingly just a singer/saloon gal, Lily was, in reality, a member of The Agency, the United States' secret monster hunting and espionage organization. 
                     In short, she was a member of the Men in Black. Despite having a few memorable play sessions with her, I ultimately found that an espionage-based, master of disguise-style character was unsuited for the often self-contained nature of West Mashes-style adventures and retied her to NPC status. 
                     She proved to be a much better quest-giver and boss for the other Agent characters than an active heroine herself. 
                     Hutchins also has engaged in two romance subplots, one of which unfortunately ended in tragedy when the object of her affection died fighting a demonic bull.

                  </figure>
                  <p1><br>My second character to go from 0 XP to max rank was Lyle Cranston, a fortune-seeking prospector. In what would prove to be a recurring trend with my characters, I deliberately designed Lyle to contrast with my prior PC. 
                  While Elijah was old, Lyle was young. Elijah hated new technology, while Lyle had a weakness for shiny toys. Elijah couldn't care less about money, while Lyle was primarily motivated by trying to get filthy rich. Etc. 
                  I actually expected Lyle's greed to be his defining characteristic when designing him on paper, but instead it ended up being his overconfidence. Armed with just a miner's pick, continual lucky dice rolls caused Lyle to go from a cocky young man to an over the top folk hero who believed his own legend. 
                  He also developed an extremely deep, abiding friendship with an undead mad scientist named Walter Kohler, and was one of the key individuals involved in convincing him to find a way to free himself from his undead condition and return to life.</p1>

                  <p1><br>Sarah Vickers is an NPC, not a player character, but I commissioned art of her, so she's getting a section too. Sarah started her existence as a throwaway joke. 
                  Walter Kohler's player decided to temporarily use a picture of the character Walter from the anime Hellsing, since they looked superficially similar and shared a name. 
                  Amused, I had a random maid at one of the hotels use a picture of the character Sarah Vickers from the same show, and thus Sarah Vickers was born. 
                  A weary, cockney girl from leads with a heavy accent, she ended up first befriending and slowly falling in love with Walter, unaware of his undead nature. 
                  This is part of what spurred his quest to return to life, and the duo are set to be married soon.</p1>

                  <p1 id ="testP" class ="funParagraph"><br>After Lyle Cranston came my most recent character to retire: Goose McGraw. Goose is a big bear of a stagecoach man and another case of me wanting to contrast my previous character. 
                     While Lyle was ambitious and loved being the center of attention, Goose was content to sit back, let others take charge, and enjoy the simple things in life. A veteran of the Civil War,  Goose somewhat acted like somebody who fought in 'Nam, and had became a hippy of sorts as backlash to his experiences. 
                     There was initially a plot about a mad ex-Confederate general who was to potentially serve as Goose's nemesis, but real life commitments on the GM's part caused that story line to die on the vine. 
                     Instead Goose's story ended up being about him deciding that, yes, he'd finally earned the right to just rest and live his life how he saw fit, a happy, content man. 
                     Of course it took defeating a demon bull with his trusty shotgun for him to realize that.</p1>
